# GameOfLifeJavaFX
Conway's game of life is a fascinating cellular automaton that brings to life many interesting patterns. 
The game of life consists of three very basic rules: 
1. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
2. Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
3. Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbours neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbours come to life, as if by reproduction.
