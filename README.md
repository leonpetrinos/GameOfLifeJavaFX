# Conway's Game of Life - JavaFX Application

Conway's Game of Life is a captivating cellular automaton that exhibits intriguing patterns. A cellular automaton consists of a grid of cells, where each cell undergoes state changes based on a predefined set of rules over time.

## Rules of the Game:
The Game of Life follows a few fundamental rules:

1. **Survival**: Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors persists to the next generation.
2. **Underpopulation**: Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies due to underpopulation.
3. **Overpopulation**: Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies due to overpopulation.
4. **Reproduction**: Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors comes to life, simulating reproduction.

## About the JavaFX Application:
This project is a JavaFX application that visually simulates Conway's Game of Life. The intuitive graphical user interface allows users to interact with the cellular automaton, observe its evolution, and discover emergent patterns.
